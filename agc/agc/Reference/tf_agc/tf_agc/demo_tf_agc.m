%% tf_agc - Time-frequency automatic gain control
%
% This code implements automatic gain control for audio signals, 
% which attempts to apply a smoothly-varying gain to an audio 
% waveform in order to keep its energy close to some target 
% level.  This version also tries to balance the energy in 
% individual frequency bands.  It works by taking the short-time
% Fourier transform of the signal, smoothing that energy using 
% time and frequency scales specified as arguments, then dividing 
% out that scaled energy.

%% Example usage

% Load a speech waveform
[d,sr] = audioread('output.wav');
% Run it through the AGC
[y,D,E] = tf_agc(d,sr);
% Listen to the gain-normalized signal
soundsc(y,sr)
% Plot the spectrogram of the input signal
subplot(311)
% (stft is my included version of specgram)
stft(d,512,512,256,sr)
% Show the time-frequency-smoothed energy envelope that has been 
% normalized out by the AGC
subplot(312)
imagesc(20*log10(E)); axis xy
% Spectrogram of the resulting, gain-normalized signal
subplot(313)
stft(y,512,512,256,sr);
%
% Other arguments:
% Using a shorter time scale for more rapid gain variation
% soundsc(tf_agc(d,sr,0.1),sr);
% Using a broader frequency scale, to minimize frequency-dependent
% gain variation
% soundsc(tf_agc(d,sr,0.5,10),sr);
% Use a narrow time and frequency scale to make signal very close
% to white noise
% soundsc(tf_agc(d,sr,0.02,0.1),sr);
% Use time-symmetric non-causal smoothing
% soundsc(tf_agc(d,sr,0.5,1.0,1),sr);
